\begin{itemize}
\item The most common error in abstracts is failure to present results, approximately the last half of the abstract should be dedicated to summarizing and interpreting your them.
\item Your abstract should not normally contain citations.
\item Although you may have written an abstract as a 'thinking tool' earlier in your writing process, you need to write the final version after you have completed the thesis so that you have a good understanding of the findings and can clearly explain your contribution to the field
